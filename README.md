# QR Scanner
Creating a QR Scanner app with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript involves integrating camera access and QR code scanning functionality. HTML provides the structure, CSS styles the layout, and JavaScript handles interactions and scanning. Utilize HTML5's `getUserMedia()` to access the camera, displaying the video feed in a designated area styled with CSS. JavaScript libraries like `instascan` simplify QR code scanning, enabling real-time decoding of codes captured by the camera. Add event listeners to trigger scanning upon detecting a QR code. Display the scanned content and handle any errors gracefully. Finally, ensure compatibility across browsers and optimize performance for seamless user experience.
